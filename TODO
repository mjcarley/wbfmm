Add:
	normal derivative operators;

relax limit on nq (nq == 1) in normal/dipole expansion coefficient
functions

"Source-free" calculations (no storage of source data for when sources
greatly outnumber targets)

Field evaluation outside source domain

Test BLAS implementation of rotation operators

Ignore empty boxes (correctly)
