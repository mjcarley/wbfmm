Indexing functions for accessing tree data structures.  


Indexing functions for accessing tree data structures. 

Functions for indexing and lookup in tree data structures, including finding neighbours and interaction lists, based on the methods of Gumerov, Duraiswami, and Borovikov, Data Structures, Optimal Choice of Parameters, and Complexity Results for Generalized Multilevel Fast Multipole Methods in d Dimensions, 2003
