Perform downward pass at one level of an octree. 

Perform one stage of a downward pass for tree levels greater than or equal to two. The actions performed are the evaluation of the list 4 contribution to the regular expansion and, for non-\/leaf boxes, a downward shift of the regular expansions to the child boxes at the next level.

Perform upward pass at one level of an octree. 

Perform one stage of the upward pass in an octree. The action performed is the upward shift of the singular expansions from boxes at level {\itshape level} to their parents.
