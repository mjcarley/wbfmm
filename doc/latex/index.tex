W\+B\+F\+M\+M is a library and collection of associated tools for the efficient solution of the Helmholtz equation and in particular the summation of fields generated by large numbers of acoustic sources.\section{Getting started}\label{index_start}
The starting point for using W\+B\+F\+M\+M is the sample programs included in the directory tests, which perform a Fast Multipole Method evaluation of the field generated by source distributions for the Helmholtz or Laplace problems.\section{What W\+B\+F\+M\+M does}\label{index_what}
