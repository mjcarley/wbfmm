Perform downward pass at one level of an octree. 

Perform one stage of a downward pass for tree levels greater than or equal to two. The actions performed are the evaluation of the list 4 contribution to the regular expansion and, for non-\/leaf boxes, a downward shift of the regular expansions to the child boxes at the next level.
