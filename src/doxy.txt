/**
 * @mainpage WBFMM: A Wide Band Fast Multipole Method library
 * 
 * WBFMM is a library and collection of associated tools for the
 * efficient solution of the Helmholtz equation and in particular the
 * summation of fields generated by large numbers of acoustic sources. 
 * 
 * @section start Getting started
 *
 * The starting point for using WBFMM is the sample programs included
 * in the directory tests, which perform a Fast Multipole Method (FMM)
 * evaluation of the field generated by source distributions for the
 * Helmholtz or Laplace problems.
 * 
 * @section what What WBFMM does
 *
 * WBFMM is a reasonably conventional FMM with standard sequence of
 * operations for any of the problems which it solves. You can see
 * sample code for field calculations in the \c tests subdirectory,
 * but the main steps are usually:
 *
 * -# define the limits of the domain containing the source and target
 * points;
 * -# allocate the WBFMM tree;
 * -# optionally sort the source points (this speeds up later
 * calculations);
 * -# set the expansion orders at each level of the tree;
 * -# initialise the rotation and translation operators required for
 * the tree calculations;
 * -# add the source points to the tree;
 * -# refine the tree to sort the points into the appropriate boxes;
 * -# initialise the memory for expansion coefficients at each level
 * of the tree;
 * -# generate the leaf expansions on the tree;
 * -# perform the upward pass, propagating expansions to the previous
 * level;
 * -# perform the downward pass, propagating local expansions to the
 * next level;
 * -# to compute the field at any point, the local expansions can be
 * evaluated as required, adding the contribution from nearby
 sources.
 *
 * WBFMM has built-in functions for each of these steps, depending on
 the problem being solved (Helmholtz or Laplace), and the example
 codes such as \c wbfmm-laplace-tree-calc show how they are used.

 * The functions described here handle spherical harmonic expansions

 * separate set of functions, for the Laplace equation (@ref
 * laplace). The expansion coefficients are packed in single- or
 * double-precision arrays with the index of coefficient
 * \f$C_{n}^{m}\f$, \f$-n\leq m \leq n\f$ given by
 * \f$i=n(n+1)+m\f$. Coefficients are represented as real and imaginary
 * parts, so that the coefficient is given by array entries
 * \f$C_{si+0}+jC_{si+1}\f$ where \f$i\f$ is the index, \f$s\f$ is a
 * stride allowing interleaved packing of data, and \f$C_{n}\f$ is an
 * array entry.
